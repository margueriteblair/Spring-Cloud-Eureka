1.Spring Cloud Eureka
2. Spring Cloud Gateway
3. Spring Cloud Hystrix


We're making two microservices in this application: an order service & a payment service. We register these two services in Eureka. Then they can talk to each other. 

We'll add an API gateway for authorization purposes.

We'll integrate an H2 database as well.
